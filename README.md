# geojson-path-finder with Leaflet and Vue example
Since it was a bit of difficult to use the library for me I came up to share the code with you.
This project demonstrates how to use the `geojson-path-finder` JavaScript library with Leaflet and Vue 3 to compute and display the shortest path on a map using GeoJSON data.

## Features

- 🗺️ **Interactive Map**: Display a Leaflet map with tile layers.
- 📍 **Shortest Path Calculation**: Compute the shortest path between two points using `geojson-path-finder`.
- 🌐 **GeoJSON Support**: Visualize GeoJSON data as a network of paths.
- ⚡ **Vue 3 & TypeScript**: Built using Vue 3's `<script setup>` syntax and TypeScript for type safety.
